# JavaScript Starter Kit

The starter kit contains all the necessary packages and scripts that you would need to kick off your next web development project using modern JavaScript and Parcel 2.

There's no need to configure Webpack, Eslint or Babel, just clone this repository and you are good to go. The boilerplate also includes a minimal project in the `./src` directory to help you quickly spin up a project.

## Getting Started

- Get a copy of the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/labnol/javascript-starter my-project
cd my-project
```

- Install the package dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Note: if you have the Yarn package manager installed, you can just run yarn.

- Open the source code in Visual Studio Code and modify the application to your liking

```bash
code .
```

- Run the app in development. Open localhost:8080 to view the app in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code.

```bash
npm start
```

- Build the app for production to the `dist/` folder. Parcel (version 2) bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

```bash
npm run build
```

Your app is ready to be deployed.
